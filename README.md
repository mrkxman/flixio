Title: Flixio â€“ A Movie/TV Show database   
 
Overview: Flixio is a React based web-app that allows users to browse and search for movies, view details such as ratings and genres, and explore trending films. Our goal with this project is to create a website similar to IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes, doing so with the use of The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

We aim to create a seamless interface that showcases all the newest/trending media, and allows users to discover the latest hits by putting all of that information into a user-friendly and easy to navigate app.
